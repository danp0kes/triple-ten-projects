    "## 1. Load Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Before a model can be made, the data will be briefly prepared for an analysis to understand the best course of action to take when creating the model. The following steps will be done to do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Import Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "Packages that enable the data to be analyzed, visualized, and modelled will be read in.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Save Dataframes\n",
    "\n",
    "The four dataframes will be saved as `contract`, `internet`, `personal`, and `phone` using pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Inspect Dataframe\n",
    "\n",
    "Determine key insights about the data and the distribution of the target by looking to the `contracts` dataframe."
