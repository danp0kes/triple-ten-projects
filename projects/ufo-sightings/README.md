# UFO Sightings (Software Development Tools)

## Purpose

Visualise UFO sighting data on a [website](https://ufo-sightings-n0w1.onrender.com).

## Process

The data was loaded, cleaned and analysed. This process can be found in this [notebook](notebooks/EDA.ipynb).

Streamlit was used to visualize data with Render that initiliazed the packages required for online viewing.

## Data

Initial data was found on kaggle and originally sourced from the National UFO Reporting Center Online Database (NURCOB). 

## Key Findings

### Timing
Saturday has the most encounters per week, July has the most per month, and Summer has the most encounters per season. Most encounters happen in the evening, followed by night, afternoon and finally mornings.

### Report Day Lag

Report day lag seems to relay that the higher the lag, the longer the duration. This may occur due to a number of reasons. While it is possible that the details of the story may change, reports with the same lag but smaller duration may not have been reported. Further analysis is needed.
