Cameras will identify when an underage person may attempt alcohol purchasing. | Tensorflow, Deep Learning, Age Detection, Alternative Practicalities    | [good-seed](projects/good-seed-cv) |
| 13     | Machine Learning for Texts| The Film Junky Union, a new edgy community for classic movie enthusiasts, is developing a system for filtering and categorizing movie reviews. The goal is to train a model to automatically detect negative reviews. IMDB movie reviews with polarity labelling will be used to build a model for classifying positive and negative reviews. | Sentimental Text Analysis, NLTK, spaCy, TF-IDF Vectorizer    | [film-junky](projects/film-junky) |
| 12     | Time Series               | Sweet Lift Taxi Company wishes to attract more drivers during peak hours. They have offered historical data on taxi orders at airports to find a model that predicts the amount of taxi orders needed for the next hour.  | Trends, Seasonality, Rolling Values, Lag Values, arima models | [taxi-time](projects/taxi-time)   |
| 11     | Numercial Methods         | Rusty Bargain, a used car company, is developing an app to help customers predict the market value of their own car. By using historical data on technical specifications and prices, they hope to implement a model that is accurate and time efficient.   | Neural Networks, Gradient Boosting, RMSE, Time Efficiency      | [rusty-bargain](projects/rusty-nn) |
| 10     | Linear Algebra            | Sure Tomorrow, an insurance company wants to improve marketing to similar customers and predict how many claims a new customers will make. They wish to do so by keeping clients' interest in mind and protecting their personal data.      | kNN, Scaling, Masking, Mathematical Proof                     | [sure-tomorrow](projects/sure-tomorrow) |
| 9      | Integrated Project 2      | Zyfra, a heavy industry company are looking for a model that can predict how much gold will be produced from gold ore. Extraction and purification metrics have been provided to optimize production and eliminate inefficent practices.    | Custom Scoring, Regression Task                               | [zyfra](projects/zyfra)           |

| 7      | Supervised Learning       | Beta Bank customers are leaving little by little each month. The bank determined it's cheaper to save existing customers than to attract new ones. A model which predicts which customers will leave soon can help Beta Bank save certain customers. | Class Weight Adjustments, Threshold Adjustments, AUC-ROC     | [betabank](projects/betabank)     |
| 6      | Intro to Machine Learning | Megaline seeks a model that can recommend a new phone plan to legacy users. | Classification Task, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Logistic Regression  | [megaline-ml](projects/megaline-ml) |
| 5      | Data Collection and Storage (SQL) |   Zuber, a new ride-sharing company is launching in Chicago. Data from competitors will be analyzed and a hypothesis about the impact of weather on ride frequency will be tested to determine how many drivers will be needed.  |               HTML Parsing, Database Query, Hypothesis Testing   |                                                     [zuber](projects/zuber)                    |
