|  Number | Subject | Description | Skills | Link | 
| -------- | ------- |------- | ------- | ------- |
| 1 | Exploratory Data Analysis    | Instacart, a grocery delivery company, requests insight into the shopping habits of their customers concerning top products and delivery times.| Basic Python - Data Cleaning, Merging, Groupby, Data Visualization | [instacart](projects/instacart-eda) |
| 2 | Statistical Data Analysis    |Megaline, a phone company, seeks to find its most profitable phone plan so it can adjust its advertising budget accordingly. An analysis on where most of its profit comes from was also undertaken.| Hypothesis Testing, Data Visualization, Revenue Analysis| [megaline-sda](projects/megaline-sda) |
| 3 | Software Development Tools   | Website implementing UFO sightings data that summarizes key findings with interactive histogram, scatter plot and interactive map with filters| Streamlit, Render, Plotly, Interactive Map| [ufo sightings](projects/ufo-sightings)|
| 4 | Integrated Project 1         |    Ice, an online gaming store wishes to plan advertising campaigns in the best way possible.   |    Hypothesis Testing, Data Visualization, User Profiling    | [ice games](projects/games-sales) |
| 5 | Data Collection and Storage (SQL)    |       |      |  |
| 6 | Intro to Machine Learning    |   Megaline seeks a model that can recommend a new phone plan to legacy users. |Classification Task, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Logistic Regression  | [megaline-ml](projects/megaline-ml) |
| 7 | Supervised Learning          |   Beta Bank customers are leaving little by little each month. The bank determined it's cheaper to save existing customers than to attract new ones. A model which predicts which customers will leave soon can help Beta Bank save certain customers. | Class Weight Adjustments, Threshold Adjustments, AUC-ROC  | [betabank](projects/betabank) |
| 8 | Machine Learning in Business |   Oily Giant mining company is seeking the ideal place for a new oil well. A model will predict which of the three regions will produce the greatest profit whilst eliminating risk.    |    Breakeven Analysis, Bootstrapping, Loss Probability | [oilygiant](projects/oilygiant-ml)|
| 9 | Integrated Project 2         |   Zyfra, a heavy industry company are looking for a model that can predict how much gold will be produced from gold ore. Extraction and purification metrics have been provided in the hopes to optimize production and eliminate inefficent practices.    |   Custom Scoring, Regression,    | [zyfra](projects/oilygiant-ml) |
